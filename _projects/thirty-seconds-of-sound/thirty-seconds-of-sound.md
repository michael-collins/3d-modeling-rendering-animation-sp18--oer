title: Thirty Seconds of Sound
subtitle: A 30 second animated short film project
layout: project
theme: cycle

# Theme: "{{ page.theme }}"

For this project, you will design, model, texture, animate, and render a thirty second animation in response to sound that you find in the **Experimental** category on [freemusicarchive.org](http://freemusicarchive.org/genre/Experimental/) to interpret the project theme, [{{ page.theme }}](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/{{ page.theme }}).

You will critically reflect on your work in a 150 word work statement.

A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, application of [formal design principles](http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf), [attention to detail](http://creativitywindow.com/2012/06/key-elements-of-product-photography) and [composition](http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2012/04/12/10-rules-of-photo-composition-and-why-they-work/), and lead to discussion about the kind of reality needed to make these objects possible and the importance of pursuing or not pursuing such realities.

## Project Completion Methodology
You will go through a variety of different project steps including:

  1. Sound identification,
  2. reference gathering and concept development,
  3. modeling and texture map production,
  4. animation,
  5. animatic editing,
  5. lighting,
  6. surface shader configuring,
  7. rendering,
  8. feedback and iterative improvement,
  9. color grading and finishing,
  10. and writing reflection.

## Constraints
- Use 3D tools to produce animation
- 30 seconds of animation
- All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset.
