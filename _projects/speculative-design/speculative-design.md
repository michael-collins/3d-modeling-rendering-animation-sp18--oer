#Un-nature

For this project, you will create three images that respond to the theme, **Un-nature**. You will design, model, texture, and render a series of speculative objects and critically reflect on how your images relate to the theme in a 150 word work statement.

You will be producing a design fiction aimed at highlighting how the nature of an object could be changed to make it ideal. You will decide what kind of attributes make an object ideal, and for what purpose. In this way, you are creating ideal objects. This fiction can take place in any time period, and can be naturally occurring, manufactured, synthetic, biological, or a mix.

The subject of [speculative design](https://vimeo.com/65074246) is the main topic for the book, _[Speculative Everything](http://www.amazon.com/Speculative-Everything-Design-Fiction-Dreaming/dp/0262019841/)_, by Dunne and Raby. An excerpt reads:
>"a shift from designing for how the world is ... to designing for how the world could be"

A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, application of [formal design principles](http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf), [attention to detail](http://creativitywindow.com/2012/06/key-elements-of-product-photography) and [composition](http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2012/04/12/10-rules-of-photo-composition-and-why-they-work/), and lead to discussion about the kind of reality needed to make these objects possible and the importance of pursuing or not pursuing such realities.

##Project Completion Methodology
You will go through a variety of different project phases including:

  1. Object identification,
  2. ideation and concept development,
  3. modeling and texture map production,
  4. lighting,
  5. surface shader configuring,
  6. rendering,
  7. feedback and iterative improvement,
  8. color grading and finishing,
  9. and writing reflection.

##Constraints
- Use 3D tools to produce images
- Three separately rendered images
- All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset.


##Deliverables
Please create a folder on box.psu.edu and name it **_project1-YOURUSERID_**. You will be adding a .txt file with a folder share link to your project folder [here](https://psu.box.com/signup/collablink/d_6330622361/13671f0b80e52a).
